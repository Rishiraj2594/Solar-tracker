# Solar-Tracker
## Despcription
This is basically a Arduino based model which will show how we can increase the efficiency of solar panel with servos and photoresistors.It can track movement of sun and move accordingly to provide maximum sun light to the solar panel.

Servos- A Servo Motor is a small device that has an output shaft. This shaft can be positioned to specific angular positions by sending the servo a coded signal.

Photoresistor-It is a type of resistor which can change resistance according to much light hit them.
