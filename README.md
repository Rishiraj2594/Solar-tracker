# Solar-Tracker
## Despcription
This is basically a Arduino based model which will show how we can increase the efficiency of solar panel with servos and photoresistors.It can track movement of sun and move accordingly to provide maximum sun light to the solar panel.

Servos- A Servo Motor is a small device that has an output shaft. This shaft can be positioned to specific angular positions by sending the servo a coded signal.

Photoresistor-It is a type of resistor which can change resistance according to much light hit them.

## Required components 
- 1x Arduino Nano
- 2x SG90 Servo
- 4x Photoresistor
- 4x 1kohm Resistor
## Construction 
We have to 3d some parts for servo and photoresitor so servo can move in circular manner and also in up down movements.
And for photresitor we have mount four of them  on a circle with 4 divided segment for example, if left part is dark the panel move clockwise and when lower part is dark panel move upwards so it can always follow the brightest light source.
